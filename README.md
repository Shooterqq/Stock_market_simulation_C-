# Stock_market_simulation

#Game Description
This is a banking simulation game where players manage their savings and investment accounts. The goal of the game is to accumulate the highest value of assets and money in the portfolio. Players have the ability to buy various types of assets, such as cryptocurrencies, currencies, real estate, and stocks. The game progresses in turns, and players can make decisions at each stage to increase the value of their investments.

#Account Types:
Savings Account:

Focuses on safely accumulating money without risk.
Players can make deposits and earn interest on savings.
The savings grow over time as each turn simulates the passage of time for deposit accumulation.
Investment Account:

Allows players to make riskier investments, such as:
Buying cryptocurrencies
Buying currencies
Buying real estate
Buying stocks
Each of these investments carries varying levels of risk and potential returns.
Game Rules:
The game is turn-based. Each turn represents a period during which the investments and deposits are updated.
At the end of each turn, the account balances and asset values are updated.
Players can interact with various features, such as buying assets, calculating account worth, and generating reports.
The winner is the player with the highest total value of assets and money in their portfolio after a set number of turns or upon completion of the game.
System Requirements:
C++11 or newer.
Installed Python 3.x.
Required Python libraries:
matplotlib (for plotting graphs)
pandas (for handling data in CSV files)
Installation
Install Python 3.x:

Download and install Python 3.x from https://www.python.org/downloads/.
Install the required Python libraries:

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the required libraries:
bash
Skopiuj kod
pip install matplotlib pandas
Compiling and Running the Program:

Use a C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++) to compile the main program.
Ensure that the Python script (e.g., PythonScript.py) is located in the same directory as the compiled executable.
Running the Game:

After compiling the program, run the game from the terminal:
bash
Skopiuj kod
./your_program_name
Features
1. Savings Account
Depositing money – adding funds to the savings account.
Calculating deposit value – simulating the growth of a deposit based on the number of turns.
Viewing account status – checking the current balance of the savings account.
2. Investment Account
Buying assets:
Cryptocurrencies: invest in popular cryptocurrencies.
Currencies: purchase different currencies.
Real Estate: buy and sell properties.
Stocks: invest in company stocks.
Generating reports – creating financial reports based on investments.
Calculating account worth – checking the current value of the investment account based on the assets owned.
3. Turn Simulation
Deposit simulation – at the end of each turn, deposit values are updated, and the savings account balance increases based on the time elapsed.
4. Graphs (Python)
The game allows generating graphs from data stored in CSV files that are updated during the game.
The Python script reads the CSV file and generates graphs showing asset and account value changes.
To display the graphs, you must install Python and the matplotlib and pandas libraries.

#Future Development Plan
The game will be expanded with additional features in the future, such as:

New types of assets (e.g., bonds, startups).
Risk options in investments.
Multiplayer mode – playing with multiple players.
Advanced investment strategies.
#Summary
The game offers a rich banking simulation where players manage finances, investments, and assets across various sectors. Players make decisions at every turn, and the goal is to maximize the value of their assets. The game is turn-based, and the financial outcomes can be visualized using Python-generated graphs.
